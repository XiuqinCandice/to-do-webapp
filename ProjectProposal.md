# Why are we building it
This project serves as an opportunity to grow our web development, project management, and software engineering skills.

Our goals:
- Use Django to build a database-driven website
- Learn to use git and Github to collaborate on a software project
    - Pull requests and code reviewing
    - Document using markdown files
    - Use Github Projects and issues to maintain a Kanban board for agile development
    - Use Github Actions to automate testing and website deployment
- Demo a version 1 product that can be extended for subsequent projects
